* Integrate `prettier` for automatic code formatting. We still want some of
  eslint's config like the a11y checking.

* Ability to render HTML like a React Component?
  Ask at https://gitter.im/styleguidist/styleguidist

* Full testing via `yarn test` like before. May need to add additional tests.

* Customise overall styleguide layout:
  https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/tree/master/examples/customised and
  https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/blob/master/examples/customised/styleguide/components/StyleGuide.js

* Depend/extend on Bootstrap, react-bootstrap etc.
